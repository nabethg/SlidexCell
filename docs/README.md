# SlidexCell


## Product Overview
The SlidexCell is a combined slider and app system designed for the [Swim Drink Fish (SDF)](https://www.swimdrinkfish.ca/) non-profit to collect environmental observations data with speed and ease across different weather conditions. It records and automatically uploads data to a spreadsheet database.


## Prototype Usage


### Main Menu
On the main page of the SlidexCell app, the user is presented with the option to edit their account, obtain information on SDF and the program, and, most notably, create a new data entry.

### Form
Creating a new data entry illustrates a first glance at the digital features that add extra functionality, rather than just completing the form similar to pen and paper. For example, the record fields can be auto-filled according to user and device data, and the info buttons next to each section provide information on sampling.

Progressing through the following screens, more data can be recorded using similar input items such as dropdown menus, text boxes, and radio buttons. Note the colour picker slider and the images for wildlife count, further demonstrating the potential of a digital design.

### Scan
The slider set to the observed values can be scanned by pressing the scan pushbutton in the app and aligning the camera with the slider. Doing so results in the slider's fields being automatically digitized and inputted into the form.

The user can terminate the scan before completion by pressing **q**.

### Submit
The entry can be submitted using the submit pushbutton located at the end of the form. Submitting the form generates a spreadsheet that includes all inputted data and is compatible with SDFâ€™s database formatting.
